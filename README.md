# slippy

Slippy is a small python package to help run geodynamic models using the Underworld framework. Mostly, it will help integrate Pygplates (currentyl unreleased) and Underworld2 (Python version of Underworld). It is hoped that in the future the the only dependencies will be pygplates and underworld. For the time being, it will rely on a number of other packages, particularly Shapely.
